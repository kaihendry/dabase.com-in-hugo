title: Configuring an external USB drive with LVM
---



	Seagate Freeagent Desktop 500GB External Hard drive 7200RPM 8MB USB2.0

For 69GBP from Amazon.co.uk. So that's about 15 pence for Gigabyte. Quite good value!

Plug it in:


	scsi 3:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Seagate  FreeAgentDesktop 100F PQ: 0 ANSI: 4

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] 976773168 512-byte hardware sectors (500108 MB)

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 1c 00 00 00

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] 976773168 512-byte hardware sectors (500108 MB)

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Mode Sense: 1c 00 00 00

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Assuming drive cache: write through

	 sdb: sdb1

	sd 3:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk

In my case it's sdb. You need to be super careful and USE THE RIGHT DISK!

Prime the disk:


	x61:~% sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb

	  Device /dev/sdb not found (or ignored by filtering).

	x61:~% sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1

	  Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" successfully created

Should show up now:


	x61:~% sudo pvscan

	  PV /dev/sda5   VG x61   lvm2 [111.55 GB / 4.00 MB free]

	  PV /dev/sdb1            lvm2 [465.76 GB]

	  Total: 2 [577.31 GB] / in use: 1 [111.55 GB] / in no VG: 1 [465.76 GB]

Now we need a Volume Group:


	x61:~% sudo vgcreate seagate /dev/sdb1

	  Volume group "seagate" successfully created

	x61:~% sudo vgscan

	  Reading all physical volumes.  This may take a while...

	  Found volume group "seagate" using metadata type lvm2

	  Found volume group "x61" using metadata type lvm2

Ok, lets create the Logical Volume:


	x61:~% sudo lvcreate -l 100%FREE -next3 seagate

	  Logical volume "ext3" created

	x61:~% sudo lvscan

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/root' [16.68 GB] inherit

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/swap_1' [2.59 GB] inherit

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/home' [80.00 GB] inherit

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/crypt' [12.27 GB] inherit

Ok, now lets create an ext3 partition on there:


	x61:~% sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/seagate/ext3

	mke2fs 1.40.6 (09-Feb-2008)

	Warning: 256-byte inodes not usable on older systems

	Filesystem label=

	OS type: Linux

	Block size=4096 (log=2)

	Fragment size=4096 (log=2)

	30531584 inodes, 122095616 blocks

	6104780 blocks (5.00%) reserved for the super user

	First data block=0

			32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,

			4096000, 7962624, 11239424, 20480000, 23887872, 71663616, 78675968,

			102400000


	Writing inode tables: done

	Creating journal (32768 blocks): done

	Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done


	This filesystem will be automatically checked every 25 mounts or

	180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.

Ok, lets test it out:


	x61:~% sudo mkdir /mnt/sg

	x61:~% sudo mount /dev/seagate/ext3 /mnt/sg

	x61:~% df -h | grep sg

						  459G  199M  435G   1% /mnt/sg

	x61:~% ll /mnt/sg

	total 24K

	drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K 2008-02-28 16:41 ./

	drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4.0K 2008-02-28 16:50 ../

	drwx------ 2 root root  16K 2008-02-28 16:41 lost+found/

SO 500G becomes about 435G....


So putting into my slug, I found I needed to make it ACTIVE by:


	slug:~% sudo lvscan

	  inactive          '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit

	slug:~% sudo lvchange -a y /dev/seagate/ext3

	slug:~% sudo lvscan

	  ACTIVE            '/dev/seagate/ext3' [465.76 GB] inherit

Ok lets share this guy:


	slug:~% egrep seagate /etc/exports

	/media/seagate 192.168.1.*(insecure,rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,nohide)

	slug:~% egrep seagate /etc/fstab

	/dev/seagate/ext3 /media/seagate auto   rw,user,auto  0       0

Problems, bugs, I wish this didn't happen:


	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2

		ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2

	end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 12807

	Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 1545

	lost page write due to I/O error on dm-0

	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2

		ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2

	end_request: I/O error, dev sdb, sector 12807

	Buffer I/O error on device dm-0, logical block 1545

	lost page write due to I/O error on dm-0

	sd 1:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2

I have noticed when initially mounting and using the device, you can see these
scary messages. The OS can decide to remount the device as readonly and then
you'll know things are going wrong. To rectifiy the situation I simply unmount
and mount the disk again and watch the logs with `tail -f /var/log/messages`.

Ok, I found the [fix for external Seagate USB hard drives](http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/FAQ/DealWithAutoSpinDownOnSeagateFreeAgent)!
