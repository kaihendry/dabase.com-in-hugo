title: Sane SUDO configuration

To edit:


	sudo visudo

Here's mine:


	# /etc/sudoers

	#

	# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.

	#

	# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.

	#

	Defaults	env_reset

	# Host alias specification

	# User alias specification

	# Cmnd alias specification

	# User privilege specification

	root	ALL=(ALL) ALL

	hendry  ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL

	ALL   ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/ifup usb0, /sbin/ifdown usb0

Some people think this is stupid. I personally don't like perms very much.
