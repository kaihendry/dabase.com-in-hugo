So what is your disk's capacity?

    x61:~% sudo pvscan
      PV /dev/sda5   VG x61   lvm2 [111.55 GB / 0    free]
      Total: 1 [111.55 GB] / in use: 1 [111.55 GB] / in no VG: 0 [0   ]

Not sure wtf is on sda1

    x61:~% cat /proc/partitions 
    major minor  #blocks  name

       8     0  117220824 sda
       8     1     248976 sda1
       8     2          1 sda2
       8     5  116969233 sda5
     254     0    7000064 dm-0
     254     1    2719744 dm-1
     254     2  107245568 dm-2
       7     0     102400 loop0
     254     3     101372 dm-3
       8    16    2015232 sdb
       8    17     184716 sdb1


To find out about your logical volumes:

    x61:~% sudo lvscan
      ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/root' [6.68 GB] inherit
      ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/swap_1' [2.59 GB] inherit
      ACTIVE            '/dev/x61/home' [102.28 GB] inherit


Remember in order to reduce say home, you first need to `resize2fs` home down and then you can think about `sudo lvreduce -L-10g /dev/x61/home`.
