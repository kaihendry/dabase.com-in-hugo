title: Debian re-install init.d configs
---


**CAVEAT** changes to the init.d are considered as _config_ changes.

Ok something wrong:

	debsums -e nfs-common
	/etc/init.d/nfs-common                                                    FAILED

Fixed like so:

	sudo apt-get --purge remove nfs-common 
	sudo apt-get install nfs-common
