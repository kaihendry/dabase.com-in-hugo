title: Installing debian without CDs or boot floppies
---


A pleasant way of installing debian is by putting a friend's hard drive in your machine and using debootstrap described in:

http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch-preparing.en.html#s-linux-upgrade

An operation like :

    /usr/sbin/debootstrap --arch i386 woody /mnt/debinst http://ftp.fi.debian.org/debian

It just cool... :) No need for downloading .isos etc. Perfect if the friend's machine does not have a floppy/cd drive too.
