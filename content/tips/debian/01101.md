title: Using the Ion window manager notes
---

Copy in the files from /etc/X11/ion2 to your homedir:

	$ tree .ion2/

	.ion2/

	|-- default-session--0

	|   |-- query_history.lua

	|   `-- workspaces.lua

	|-- dock.lua

	|-- ion-bindings.lua

	`-- ion.lua

	1 directory, 5 files
Then edit there.
default-session--0 seems to be maintained by Ion. But this is precarious on my system, because I always `sudo init 0` to shut down and I don't think it has the opportunity to save my settings.
In:
/home/hendry/.ion2/default-session--0/workspaces.lua amongst some awful syntax is some "WIonWS".
I named the last one I saw "web".
In ~/.ion2/ion.lua I added the winprop:

	winprop {
    class = "Firefox-bin",
    instance = "Gecko",
    target = "web"

	}
I got the class and instance settings by running in a nearby frame from uxterm (alt+k s for vsplit):

	$ xprop WM_CLASS
Then selecting my running browser, where it will spit out these important values = instance, class variables for use in Ion's winprop.

	WM_CLASS(STRING) = "Gecko", "Firefox-bin"
Then I made an ~/.xsession with:

	/usr/bin/mozilla-firefox &

	x-terminal-emulator -e screen &

	exec x-window-manager
I tried stuff ~/xinitrc(what about ~/.xclients ??), but it didn't work for some reason.
Now when I log in, firefox is loaded. I don't have to waste 10 seconds of my life everytime I log in!!
