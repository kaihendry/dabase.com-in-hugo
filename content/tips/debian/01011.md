title: Writing CDs (Backing up your Mail)
---


You shouldn't backup anything to compact disc media. However if you're dumb
enough to back up to a unreliable media (as I once did), you mind find the
following old tips helpful:

I never ever remember this. So here I am recording the information about burning CDs with :

    mkisofs -o /tmp/backup.iso .
    cdrecord -scanbus
    cdrecord -v speed=12 dev=0,0,0 -data /tmp/backup.iso

I back up my mail every so often. I generally keep my mail. My last backup of mail was 50 megs, compressed! GULP.

    tar cvf backup.tar Mail/
    bzip2 backup.tar

Encrypting my mail:

    gpg -e -r hendry backup.tar.bz2

To decrypt, word of advice, do not use gpg -d, just use:

    gpg backup.tar.bz2.gpg
