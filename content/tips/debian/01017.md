title: Backgrounding a process
---


Say you run a process to check its Stdout debug messages, or you just forget to put the ampersand in after its name, this is how I do about backgrounding it.

    hendry@bilbo:~$ straw

Now hit CTRL+z

    [1]+  Stopped                 straw

bg for actually backgrounding the process

    hendry@bilbo:~$ bg
    [1]+ straw &

And finally:

    hendry@bilbo:~$ disown

In order to make sure the process survives if I decide to kill the xterm it was launched in!
