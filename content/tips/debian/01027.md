title: Keeping track of changes in unstable
---


If you want to use unstable you should install apt-listchanges then you
can received what's changed in the latest upgrade like :
fontconfig (2.2.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

    * The "Society For Creative Anachronism Seizes Control Of Russia"
    release.
    * debian/control:
    - Recommend ttf-bitstream-vera, since it is the default fallback font
      now.  Plus it does look pretty nice.  (Closes: #190675).
    - Suggest: ttf-freefont, my favorite font.
