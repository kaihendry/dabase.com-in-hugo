title: BIN-NMU
---

When a library changes, the packages the depend on it often need to be recompiled. Hence the bin-nmu.
Though this automagic goodness for Release Managers is a fairly recent innovation.

	16:01 < hendry> i don't quite understand

	16:01 < hendry> how can it just be a change to the changelog

	16:02 < hendry> is this just to hack, because Katie won't retrieve same source upgrades

	16:03 < pabs> no, its just so that the version is higher in the new .deb

	16:05 < pabs> example changelog entry: http://paste.debian.net/8186

	16:08 < pabs> and katie is no longer named katie

	16:09 < pabs> you can find a list of binNMUed packages with aptitude search '~V\+b[0-9]+$'

	16:12 < pabs> basically it is a way for the release managers to simply recompile packages when that is
              nessecary. like if a library moves to a new soname, the packages depending on it can be binNMUed

	16:48 < adsb-work> Technically it's a recompile with no source changes, hence a binary NMU
