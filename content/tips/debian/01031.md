I always forget this one:

    16:26 < hendry> FAQ: How do I stop reconnects?
    16:26 < hoxu> hendry, /rmreconns?

And it is in the FAQ of course:

http://irssi.org/?page=docs&doc=faq

    17:17 < hendry> Can I log a conversation that has already taken place? I can see it in my buffer?
    17:17 < [Ward]>  /lastlog -file

If you use ION, you can select the hidden windows with Esc-n
