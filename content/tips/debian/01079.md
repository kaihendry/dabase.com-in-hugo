title: Exim 4 Catchall
---

Add another file in the router directory for catchall to work.

	hendry@bilbo:/etc/exim4/conf.d/router$ cat 950_exim4-config_catchall

	catch_all:
   debug_print = "R: catch_all for $local_part@$domain"
   driver = redirect
   data = ${lookup{*}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}

	hendry@bilbo:/etc/exim4/conf.d/router$ egrep hendry /etc/aliases

	root: hendry

	*: hendry
With other people. I have yet to figure out how to configure different aliases for different hosts, but I am not worried about that problem atm.
