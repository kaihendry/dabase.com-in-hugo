title: Use 'sudo', not 'su'
---


On many previous occassions, I would show people how to upgrade their debians
boxes. First I would su to root. This is not good practice. Use sudo instead,
and use your user password.  Example:

    sudo apt-get update

Update package listings, and then upgrade :)

    sudo apt-get -u dist-upgrade
