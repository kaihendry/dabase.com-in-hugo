title: How to find the Debian version of an installed package
---


Finding the package version in Debian isn't trivial. `dpkg -l bash` looks like
crap.

Best I've found is:

	dpkg --status live-helper | egrep "^Version" | awk '{print $2}'

You could grep `/var/lib/dpkg/available`, though I think it isn't very efficient.
