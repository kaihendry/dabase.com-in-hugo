title: How to extend a LVM partition
---


Previously I setup an [[encrypted_LVM|01202]] partition which didn't work out.

So I wanted to use that defunct 'crypt' 10G partition to extend my home
partition.

At first I had a [problem deactivating the
disk](http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-lvm-maintainers/2008-April/001684.html).
The solution was:

	sudo dmsetup remove x61-crypt

**Now** I am able to deactivate it:

	sudo lvremove /dev/x61/crypt

Now I need to resize my home disk to take up all the **free space** on my
drive:

	sudo lvextend /dev/x61/home -l+100%FREE

Then finally since the new extended LVM disk is larger, I can do an online resize (not unmounting required) to finish it all off).

	x61:~% sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/x61-home
	resize2fs 1.40.8 (13-Mar-2008)
	Filesystem at /dev/mapper/x61-home is mounted on /home; on-line resizing required
	old desc_blocks = 5, new_desc_blocks = 6
	Performing an on-line resize of /dev/mapper/x61-home to 24189952 (4k) blocks.
	The filesystem on /dev/mapper/x61-home is now 24189952 blocks long.

Now I am upto:

	x61:~% df -h | grep home
	/dev/mapper/x61-home   91G   67G   22G  76% /home
