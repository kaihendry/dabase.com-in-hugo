title: CVS checking/viewing differences between versions after commit
---

Lalala, here I go commiting a file:

	hendry@bogrund-14:~/digimon/doc/RequirementsAnalysis$ cvs commit RequirementAnalysis.tex

	Checking in RequirementAnalysis.tex;

	/home/group/digimon/cvsroot/doc/RequirementsAnalysis/RequirementAnalysis.tex,v  <--  RequirementAnalysis.tex

	new revision: 1.3; previous revision: 1.2

	done
But what if I forgot the version?

	hendry@bogrund-14:~/digimon/doc/RequirementsAnalysis$ cvs status RequirementAnalysis.tex

	===================================================================

	File: RequirementAnalysis.tex   Status: Up-to-date
   Working revision:    1.3     Mon Jun 23 10:53:03 2003
   Repository revision: 1.3     /home/group/digimon/cvsroot/doc/RequirementsAnalysis/RequirementAnalysis.tex,v
   Sticky Tag:          (none)
   Sticky Date:         (none)
   Sticky Options:      (none)
Well, knowing that, lets see the differences with the previous revision.

	hendry@bogrund-14:~/digimon/doc/RequirementsAnalysis$ cvs diff -u -r 1.2 -r 1.3 RequirementAnalysis.tex
Was that hard? YEAH
