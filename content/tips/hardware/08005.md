title: Losing power whilst recording with Audacity
---


After launching Audacity, selecting the autosave you might be greeted with a ["not well formed - invalid token"](http://s.natalian.org/2013-08-16/1376642128_1366x768.png) error. That means the XML autosave is corrupted.

Under `~/.audacity-data/AutoSave` you will probably find an invalid file like so:

	~/.audacity-data/AutoSave$ xmlstarlet val cryptoparty2.autosave 
	cryptoparty2.autosave - invalid

Open the file in vim, go to the bottom with the `G` shortcut and hopefully you will notice some obvious gibberish like:

	^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@</project>

Remove it, validate the XML is good. Now you should be able to open it in Audacity.
