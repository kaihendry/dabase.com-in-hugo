MP/MEP's are born compromisers, by definition. If they see a conflict, they
must:


	1. take sides (but not openly/irrevocably unless everyone agrees)

	2. pretend to mediate

	3. take credit, whoever wins.
Therefore, you cannot just give them the problem, they need to see that you
appreciate their needs and have considered what they can DO.
