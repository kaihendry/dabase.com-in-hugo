title: How to forward network ports to systemd-nspawn containers
---


Assuming you've setup ~/containers/ssh to start a sshd on **boot**:

	sudo systemd-nspawn -D ~/containers/ssh -n -b -p 23:22

The magic is the `--port` aka `-p` switch that [allows port forwarding](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/456#issuecomment-125381351) from the host to the container.


So when I `ssh -p 23 $host` I get to my ssh container, since it's redirected to port 22. Sadly ssh **does not send the hostname as part of the SSH protocol** as discussed in <http://serverfault.com/questions/34552/is-there-a-name-based-virtual-host-ssh-reverse-proxy>.
