I spend an hour over this confusing error message and I hope this will save
you some time!

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName foo.example.com
		ProxyPass / https://localhost:81/
		ProxyPassReverse / https://localhost:81/
	</VirtualHost>

What's the issue?! **SSL!** Your Docker container is probably not listening off SSL. The fix:

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName foo.example.com
		ProxyPass / http://localhost:81/
		ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:81/
	</VirtualHost>
