title: Exit Makefile on error
---


What's the problem with this?

	all: foo bar
		@for i in $^ ; \
		do \
			false ; \
			echo $$i ; \
		done
	.PHONY: all foo bar

Well even though `false` trips up, the `make` will just continue. Usually Make
will just croak if something goes wrong, but since everything is neatly in a
`for` stanza, this is easy to miss. I wonder if there is a way to `set -e` on
Make invoked shells?

Otherwise to fix the problem, you need to add `set -e`, like so:

	all: foo bar
		@set -e; for i in $^ ; \
		do \
			false ; \
			echo $$i ; \
		done

	.PHONY: all foo bar
