Using `ffprobe` which should be included in a [ffmpeg](https://twitter.com/FFmpeg) distribution:


	for m in *.MOV
	do
			r=$(ffprobe $m 2>&1 | grep -i rotate | awk '{print $3}')
			case $r in
					90)
							echo Needs to be $m 90 degrees
							;;
					180)
							echo Needs to be $m 180 degrees
							;;
					270)
							echo Needs to be $m 270 degrees
							;;
					*)
							echo No rotating required $m
			esac
	done
