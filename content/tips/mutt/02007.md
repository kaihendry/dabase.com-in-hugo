title: Edit messages properly
---

Sven has a page to encourage good editing practices here:
http://learn.to/edit_messages/
That is one of my many many pet hates. Bad editing. Learn how to do it properly, it is such an essential skill, such as learning to read and *write*, however in the domain of the Internet.
