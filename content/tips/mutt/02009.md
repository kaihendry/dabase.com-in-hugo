title: Merging maildirs
---

I tend to use several machines. But I want all my mail somewhere so I can search it with mairix for example.
On my laptop I have sent-mail-07-2003/ maildir. I also have the same maildir on my home machine bilbo, however with different mails.
I want to merge those two folders at some point, without overwriting or losing mails.
After copying sent-mail-07-2003/ from my laptop across to bilbo's /tmp, I proceeded to:

	cd /tmp

	cp -R --preserve --reply=no sent-mail-07-2003 ~/Mail/sent-mail/
And it seems to work.=)
