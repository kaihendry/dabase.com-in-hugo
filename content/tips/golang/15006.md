title: How to delete an empty value in a slice in golang?
---


There is no **delete** in a slice, since in golang slices are not that high
level. You can think of them as variable-length c arrays. Do take time to read <http://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals>

Given a slice like:

	s := []string{"foo", "", "bar", ""}

https://play.golang.org/p/7RzNelz947

How do you remove the empty values simply? i.e. printing an end result:

    ["foo" "bar"]

https://play.golang.org/p/fxVyC4WqjR

	func delete_empty (s []string) []string {
		var r []string
		for _, str := range s {
			if str != "" {
				r = append(r, str)
			}
		}
		return r
	}

# Alternatively

Another approach is to define a helper function, ala <https://play.golang.org/p/Xcno8QurAn>
