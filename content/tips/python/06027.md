---


Note raise! Very useful.

	#!/usr/bin/env python2


	def getlineword(filelist, lineno):
        """
        Line number one is the first line
        Returns first word on the line.
        """
        try:
                return filelist[lineno-1].split()[0]
        except:
                raise

	if __name__ == '__main__':
        """
        Does a head
        """
        file = open('../file_list')
        filelist = file.readlines()
        for i in range(1,11):
                print 'Line no: %s\tEntry: %s' % (i,   getlineword(filelist, i))
        file.close()
