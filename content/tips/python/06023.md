title: Joining a list of strings, or ints
---

I think the join syntax is slightly strange:

	>>> list = ['cow','dog','cat']

	>>> print list.join()

	Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

	AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'join'

	>>> print join.list()

	Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

	NameError: name 'join' is not defined

	>>> print ''.join.list

	Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

	AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute  'list'

	>>> print ''.join(list)

	cowdogcat

	>>> print ' '.join(list)

	cow dog cat

	>>>
Ok if you try join a list of ints:

	>>> ' '.join([12,34,56,78])

	Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?

	TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found
It will not work. What you need is to convert each int into a str. Nasty, I know :

	>>> ' '.join(map(str,([12,34,56,78])))

	'12 34 56 78'
Thanks to #python, in partic. dash
