title: Parsing XML root attributes
---


Imagine you want to read the attribute **test=** from this fragment of XML called `test.xml`:

	<widget test="foo">
		<name>blah</name>
	</widget>

Using [lxml](http://packages.qa.debian.org/l/lxml.html), you need to run **getroot**.

	import lxml.etree as etree
	tree = etree.parse("test.xml")
	print(tree.getroot().attrib['test'])
