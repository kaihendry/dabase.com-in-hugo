Watch out when printing floats:

	13:07 < hendry> print (0.0424, 0.0343) # prints (0.0424, 0.034299999999999997), why not: (0.0424, 0.0343) ?

	13:07 < Erwin> hendry: because there is no such floating point number as 0.0343

	13:07 < Erwin> python used to round when printing at random times but does not do that anymore.

	13:07 < hendry> print (0.0343) is ok though??

	13:08 < hendry> bit inconsistent seemingly

	13:08 < Erwin> when you print a single value,with print, it uses str which rounds

	13:08 < Erwin> when you print a tuple or a list with str, each item is repr'ed

	13:09 < Erwin> >>> print (0.0343,)

	13:09 < Erwin> (0.034299999999999997,)

	13:09 < Erwin> this makes a tuple

	13:09 < hendry> Thanks Erwin

	13:09 < hendry> You made that clear.
