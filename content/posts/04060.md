title: Protected dir listing on Apache 2.4
---


We only password protect directories here since IOS Safari seems to prompt on every URL:

	<Files .>
	AuthType Digest
	AuthName "cam"
	AuthBasicProvider file
	AuthUserFile "/etc/httpd/digest-password"
	Require valid-user
	</Files>

Fix for mobile devices:

	IndexHeadInsert "<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">"
