title: Working with a directories of unknown files
---


Using <http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/020> as a starting point, you could:

	find /tmp -type f -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file
	do
	   echo properly escaped "$file" for doing stuff
	done

However that's a bit ugly. And note that `-d ''` only works in bash. So none of this is "POSIX".

Another way of writing this, which works from bash 4 is using dotglob/globstar:

	shopt -s dotglob  # find .FILES
	shopt -s globstar # make ** recurse
	for f in /tmp/**
	do
		if [[ -f $f && ! -L $f ]]
		then
			echo properly escaped "$f" for doing stuff
		fi
	done

Another perhaps more POSIX way is

	foo () { for i in "$@"; do echo $i; done };export -f foo;find /tmp -type f -exec bash -c 'foo "$@"' - {} + | wc -l

I.e. export a script function to be executed by the -exec parameter of find, or just use a seperate script file.
