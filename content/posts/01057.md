Enable core dumps:

	ulimit -c unlimited
The next time some application (e.g. mutt) crashes with a segfault you'll see that the message "Segmentation fault" changed to "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" and you'll find a file named "core".
the run gdb with the example executable mutt like:

	gdb mutt core
