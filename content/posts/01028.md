This is to convert all my voice wavs to the compressed speex format:

    for i in `ls *.wav`; do speexenc $i `basename $i .wav`.spx; echo $i compressed...; done

Finding BASH version:

    set | grep BASH_VERSION

System wide settings go here:

    /etc/bash.bashrc

And also:

    /etc/profile

Remove a word: CTRL+w
