title: Normative, Idiomatic, Canonical
---


At first glances:

* normative
* idiomatic
* canonical

Could seem roughly the same, though there are some _subtle_ differences.

## Normative

Normative as opposed to informative or simply non-normative is used to express
the **standard defined** way of doing something. This concept is used
everywhere in <http://www.w3.org/> specifications.

## Idiomatic

Idiomatic is largely about **convention** and **style**.

Instead of saying, this function block "adheres to commonly accepted style", you can abbreviate this statement simply to 'idiomatic'. The word "idiomatic" is commonly used in texts at <http://golang.org/>.

## Canonical

Canonical is the prescriptive, reproducible way of doing something. A good example is XML [canonicalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization).
