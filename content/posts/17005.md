title: Webkit versions in Archlinux
---


At time of writing:

* [webkit2gtk](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=webkit2gtk) (2.6.5-1) is webkit2 (current in Archlinux) - UA Safari/601.1 - **2.8.0** is current at <http://webkitgtk.org/>
* [webkitgtk2](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=webkitgtk2) (2.4.8-1) is webkit1 (not actively maintained since 2014) - UA Safari/537.15

Unfortunately the current version (early 2015) of
[surf](http://surf.suckless.org/) is built against the older _webkit1_ /
**webkitgtk2** API. There is a newer port `git://quinq.eu.org/surf2` however it
has some issues:

* on asynchronous stuff, occasionally it hangs up
* Also it leaks memory on webthings (don't really know which ones) related to JS

[Blink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_%28layout_engine%29) AFAIK is not
packaged by any distribution as yet. I don't know why.

I've discovered the [gst-omx
optimised](http://www.raspberrypi.org/web-browser-released/) for [smooth
playback of videos on the Raspberry
PI](http://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=8673) build of Webkit is
only available against **webkit2**.
