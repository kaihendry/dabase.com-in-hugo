# Working workflows

## Deleting a file in my media workflow

	git ls-files $file --error-unmatch && git annex metadata -t drop $file && git rm $file

Explanation:

`git ls-files $file --error-unmatch` checks $file is actually in git. I make
the assumption here that if the file is in git, then it has been already added to git-annex.

`git annex metadata -t drop $file` tags the file as dropped. This is useful if
I accidentally import or copy it in again.

`git rm $file` actually deletes the file

## UN-deleting a file

	git reset HEAD $file
	git checkout HEAD $file

# Gotchas

To make sure everything is OK, you must `git annex add` and `git commit` before deleting!!

Otherwise you will get confusing `error: pathspec '$file' did not match any file(s) known to git.` messages.

IIUC if you delete a file that just `git annex add`, it is possible you can
fish it out of `.git/annex/objects` but the filename would be obfuscated. `git
log --stat git-annex` & `git-log --name-only git-annex` will give you
visibility of the [internals](http://git-annex.branchable.com/internals/).

## Remove contents of deleted file

This removes all "drop" tagged media:

	git annex drop --metadata=tag=drop --force
