title: Ensure www-data is always able to write
---


Annoyingly different distros run under different users, i.e. not `www-data`.  I test with:

	<?php echo exec('whoami'); ?>

For example I think Fedora use `apache` user even if you use nginx. Debian is
better since it generally uses "www-data" across the board.

Ensure your fs is mounted with `acl` in order for the `setfacl` commands to work!

	 mount | grep acl
	/dev/root on / type ext3 (rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro,acl,barrier=0,data=writeback)

or check with `sudo tune2fs -l $YOUR_DISK | grep Default`

Now to ensure www-data always has free reign:

	# chmod g+s . # Make sure properties are inherited
	# setfacl -R -m default:group:www-data:rwx /srv/www

See <https://github.com/kaihendry/myresponder/blob/master/setup.sh> for a fully worked example.

Again `getfacl` get check!
