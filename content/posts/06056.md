title: Unique elements from a list
---

There is a couple of new ways with 2.3:
http://tinyurl.com/v72w
Otherwise:
    def unique(self, list):
        d = {}
        for x in list:
            d[x] = 1
        subset = d.keys()
        return subset
Or list comp:

	[x for x in data if data.count(x) == 1]
Or with sets.
