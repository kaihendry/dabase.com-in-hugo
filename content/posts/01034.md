This link has most of the info:

http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/users-guide/ch-ctsystem.en.html#s-ctkm
http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-euro-support/ch-configure.en.html

Quick solution:

    loadkeys gb

System:

    dpkg-reconfigure console-data
    dpkg-reconfigure locales

In Ubuntu:

    <Mithrandir> just use locale-gen $locale
    ko_KR.UTF-8
    you could also look it up in /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
