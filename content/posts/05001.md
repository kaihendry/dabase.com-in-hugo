title: NO to the de-facto monopoly Microsoft

Why do I not use Windows?
* It is not free
* The source code "recipe" is not availible, hence you do not know what it is exactly doing.
* If you do not know what it is doing, it could be maybe monitoring your every keystroke and reading your mail.
* If other software companies don't know what it is doing, then it is very difficult to make software for it.
* If you do make decent software for it miracously, expect Microsoft to push you out the market by refusing to support your software or coming up with its own standards.
* You are a slave to what ever they come up with. They dictate the OS components etc. You do not have the freedom of choice.
