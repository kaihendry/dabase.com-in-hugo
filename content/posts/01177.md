title: Xorgs version

	12:04 <hendry> i'm using wheezy Xorg packages  1:7.7+3~deb7u1 and http://ix.io/d2p says X.Org X Server 1.12.4
	12:04 <hendry> Release Date: 2012-08-27
	12:04 <hendry> Is that right?
	12:05 <jcristau> probably
	12:11 <hendry> wondering why there is a mis-match with versions
	12:11 <hendry> is there a newer Xorg available for wheezy? something to eek out performance with intel cards
	12:12 <jcristau> there isn't a mismatch
	12:12 <jcristau> and no
	12:12 <hendry> 1:7.7+3~deb7u1 & 1.12.4 doesn't make sense to me ... :}
	12:13 <jcristau> you can't understand that different things can have different versions?
	12:20 <hendry> so what does 7.7+3~deb7u1 refer to ?
	12:22 <pochu> 7.7 is the upstream version, +3 is the debian revision, and deb7u1 is the first update to Debian 7 (wheezy)
	12:22 <psychon> http://www.x.org/wiki/Releases/7.7/
	12:28 <jcristau> 7.7 is the base version of X.Org's X11 distribution
	12:28 <jcristau> 1.12.4 is the version of the X server
