Just use the Web application [Google groups](http://groups.google.com/)

slrn used to be to be the killer app for this.
what really annoyed me was when I was reading a post, and I hit ESC to get supposingly to article listing, would instead take me back to the newsgroup listing.
the key wasn't q,Q either, it was h. Take note.
