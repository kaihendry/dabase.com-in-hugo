Spell checking with british English dictionary:

	:setlocal spell spelllang=en_gb

A convienance bind:

	map <F8> :setlocal spell spelllang=en_gb<CR>

Highlighted words are probably incorrect.

* `]s` move to next spelling error
* `z=`  spelling suggestion
* `1z=` correct to most likely correction (same as `z=` and hitting 1)

Bind to backspace for your .vimrc:

	noremap <BS>, <ESC>:set spell<CR>$[s1z=:set nospell<CR>
