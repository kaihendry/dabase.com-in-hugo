!They do not mix!
HOWTO TEST FSFS

	tar zxf subversion-1.2.1.tar.gz

	cd subversion-1.2.1

	./configure --prefix=/home/myhome/opt --without-berkeley-db --with-ssl  \

	--with-zlib --enable-all-static

	make

	make fsfscheck
If there is any sort of error, there is probably a problem.

You can't just do a cp -r with the repo, because you'll get an inconsistent database. Use hotcopy.

	svnadmin hotcopy /path/to/nfs/share/repo /local/normal/fs/mount/repo
If you did a cp -r or a tar or something, use svnadmin recover to fix up the repo.
Then once you have found a new "NFS share"-free home for the repo, your working dirs need to switch their URL to the new repo, using:

	svn switch --relocate
