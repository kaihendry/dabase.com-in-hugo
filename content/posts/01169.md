	  kqemu-common libbind9-40 libisccfg40 foomatic-filters foomatic-db samba-common libservlet2.3-java libisc45 lib64objc2
	Use 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.
	The following extra packages will be installed:

	The following packages will be upgraded:
	  libgcj-common
	1 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 21 not upgraded.

	You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
	The following packages have unmet dependencies.
	  eclipse-gcj: Depends: java-gcj-compat-dev
	  java-gcj-compat-headless: Depends: libgcj-common (>= 1:4.4.0-2) but 1:4.3.3-5 is to be installed
	  libgcj-bc: Depends: libgcj-common (>= 1:4.4.0-4) but 1:4.3.3-5 is to be installed
	E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).


# Solution

	dpkg --force-depends --purge java-gcj-compat-dev
	apt-get -f install
