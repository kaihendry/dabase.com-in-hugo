title: Undoing and bouncing between changes

	:help i_CTRL-G_u

Or <Esc> with `u` to under & <CTRL>+[r] to redo

`g,` and `g;` (I think) jumps between location points in the changelist.

Most people just use:

	u<C-r> to see if something changes and then bounce around with <C-o> and <C-i>

Also see:

	:help DiffOrig
