title: Dropping into the interpreter after an ERROR to debug
---

Useful one

	14:07 < hendry> Can I make a python program drop into it's own interpreter, instead of bash when a program fails?

	14:07 < hendry> I don't want to lose these large objects if some command fails

	14:07 < Rafterman> python -i
