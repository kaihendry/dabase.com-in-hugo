I won't use Gmail. I use mutt. :)
But for my sister it may be quite a useful interface.
Her /home/jutta/.forward looks like:

	jutta

	jhendry@gmail.com
Here is the email I wrote:
People send mail to jutta@prazefarm.co.uk

It goes to my server in Finland.
My server accepts it.
It keeps one copy of the mail.
It sends another copy to jhendry@gmail.com

If my server goes down then my server can't accept mail. If this happens
do not panic. You *could* give jhendry@gmail.com as an *interim*
address. This is very bad scenario. If you notice your friends writing
mails to jhendry@gmail.com rather than jutta@prazefarm.co.uk when my
server is working, correct them!

I do not trust gmail. But I have set this account up for you as it is
better than Ilohamail, and it sort of forms a backup if my server goes
down. Gmail can't pickup mail as it wants you to use the service
exclusively, hence the sending another copy part.

If gmail sucks or you are concerned about your privacy then you can
always goto mail.dabase.com. All your incoming mail will go to both.

Use whatever you prefer.
