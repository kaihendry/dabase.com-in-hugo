Convincing people to make the switch is pretty damn difficult. However I can suggest you use a Live Linux filesystem distro such as:

* [Debian Live](http://debian-live.alioth.debian.org/)
* [Webconverger](http://webconverger.com/)

To show them. It does not touch their hard drive, so they have nothing to fear. And they can sit back and play around with linux. It is also a good indicator to see if the NIC or modem will work etc. etc.
