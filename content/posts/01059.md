title: T30 2366-PM1 with Debian SID

See:

and

I hate compiling my own kernels and always opt for Debian stock kernels.
I have got everything working except :
Hibernate/suspend which I don't really need.
A T30 with a new full battery can only expect to get about 2 hours of life. Pretty lame. Still useful in a UPS capacity.
I have not bothered to configure the power button to shutdown the machine.
The CISCO wireless card is a bit dissapointing. I can't it to work! :(
