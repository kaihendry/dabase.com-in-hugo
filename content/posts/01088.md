title: dhclient requesting without physical connection
---

apt-cache show ifplugd

	20:44 < hendry> Is it a bug if dhclient does requests when there is no physical connection ?

	20:44 < Tv> dhclient is too stupid to understand anything else

	20:45 < Tv> use ifplugd to down the interface when it's not connected
