You want DMA and 32bit on to get reasonable performance.

	hendry@scrooge-15:~$ sudo hdparm /dev/hda

	/dev/hda:
  multcount    =  0 (off)
  IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
  unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
  using_dma    =  1 (on)
  keepsettings =  0 (off)
  readonly     =  0 (off)
  readahead    = 256 (on)
  geometry     = 65535/16/63, sectors = 117210240, start = 0
Debian SID has a configuration option:

	/etc/hdparm.conf

	/dev/hda {
         dma = on
         interrupt_unmask = on
         io32_support = 1

	}

	/dev/hdc {
         dma = on
         interrupt_unmask = on
         io32_support = 1

	}
