Bash Parameter Expansion is the expansion of a parameter: $foo, $1. You can use
it to perform more complex operations: ${file%.mp3}, ${0##*/}. Remember you
should almost *always* quote them: echo "$foo". See
[http://wooledge.org:8000/BashFAQ/073](http://wooledge.org:8000/BashFAQ/073)

	FOO="bar" && echo "${FOO:0:1}"

The POSIX way (recommended) is to use **cut**:

	echo bar | cut -c 1
