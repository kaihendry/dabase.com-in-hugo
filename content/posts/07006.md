Firstly:

	apt-get install vim-python
for Vi IMproved, with python scripting support
hello.py:

	import vim

	count = 0

	for b in vim.buffers:
         print "Length of buffer %s: %s" % (count, len(b))
         count = count + 1

	vim.command("help python")
In vim:

	:pyfile hello.py
Or you could just run command after command, like:

	:python import vim
Er, check the docs

	:help python
